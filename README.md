## Electric Bonsai

This project is more of an art project, or a Maker Projct than an IT project. 

the goal of this project is to create a light source of fading alternating lights to create the illusion of biolumenecence. One is a regular LED the other is in the UC spectrum. 

Due to space and financial constraints an ATtiney13v is used. The two PWM ports are used to fade two LEDs. 

The Bonsai is a 10 cm tall 3D sculpture made from PLA. (produced with a 3d pen)
